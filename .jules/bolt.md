## 2025-05-22 - [IP Expansion Memory Optimization]
**Learning:** Returning a full list of IPs from CIDR expansion (e.g., for /16 or /8 ranges) can cause memory exhaustion (OOM) and significant performance delays due to large allocations.
**Action:** Always use generators/iterators for expanding large network ranges, and calculate the count of IPs mathematically instead of expanding the entire range.
